## How do I approach designing software? 

My software development process typically begins with a careful analysis of the project requirements. Having a solid understanding of the overall scope and desired outcomes will inform the rest of the process. After that, I break down and detail each component of the project. Even though I am working as a solo developer and the scope of the project is relatively small, I have found that following a modified Agile methodology has worked very well. I attempt to getting a working prototype running as soon as possible and continue to cycle through designing, developing, and testing new features.

## How do I approach developing programs? 

While working with modern OpenGL, most of my typical design approach was applicable. After setting up a project getting it to display a blank window was the first step. From there I would add features one at a time. Creating a camera system was my first objective, as being able to control the viewpoint of the window helps immensely with setup and troubleshooting future steps. Creating the models is where I focused next, both creating some primitives from scratch (planes, cubes, pyramids) and importing libraries for more complex shapes (spheres, cylinders, tori). Setting up the shaders, then creating and importing textures and specular maps followed. Finally, light sources were placed and fine-tuned. The code was written modularly, so components could easily be reused between projects.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

In both my personal and educational works, I have dealt with programs which utilize OpenGL. Although these applications have several layers of abstraction from the “bare metal” OpenGL used in this project, I feel I now have a much better understanding of the workings of these applications. The skills and knowledge I gained from this course can be applied to a variety of fields. Video game development is an area of interest, if even just at the hobbyist level. Computational graphics and visualization will undoubtedly aide me in becoming a more proficient developer in this area.
